## Few lines about myself
Hi, my name is Quyen, I'm currently a student at the National Economics University.
I am majoring Computer Science, I love to write code because I love how I can control
the computer, it makes me feel powerful, haha.

So that's a little bit about me. Hope that i can master using Github one day.
